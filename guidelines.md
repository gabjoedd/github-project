# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We appreciate your time and effort in helping to make this a better project. The following is a set of guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

- **Search for Duplicates**: Before submitting a new issue, please check if it has already been reported. If it has, feel free to add your comments or additional information to the existing issue.
- **Clear and Descriptive Titles**: Provide a descriptive title that clearly summarizes the issue.
- **Detailed Description**: Include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior. If possible, attach screenshots or logs to help understand the issue better.
- **Labels**: If you have permission to add labels, please do so to categorize the issue appropriately.

### 2. Proposing Changes

- **Discuss First**: If you're planning to work on a big feature or a significant change, it's better to start by opening an issue to discuss it with the community and maintainers.
- **Fork the Repository**: If you want to contribute code, start by forking the repository and creating a new branch from `main` (or `master`).
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit should ideally represent one logical change.
- **Follow the Code Style**: Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style and guidelines. Refer to the `.editorconfig` or any style guide provided in the repository.
- **Test Your Changes**: If your change affects the code, make sure to add tests and ensure all existing tests pass.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests

- **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready, open a pull request to the `main` (or `master`) branch. Fill out the PR template if one is provided.
- **Link to Issues**: If your PR addresses an open issue, link it in the description (e.g., "Closes #123").
- **Keep PRs Small and Focused**: Try to keep your pull requests small and focused on a single issue or feature. This makes it easier to review and increases the chances of it being merged quickly.
- **Update Documentation**: If your change affects how users interact with the project, update the documentation accordingly.
- **Be Responsive**: Be prepared to make adjustments based on feedback from the maintainers and other contributors.

### 4. Code Review Process

- **Respectful Communication**: When reviewing others' code or receiving feedback on your own, maintain a respectful and constructive tone.
- **Provide Constructive Feedback**: If you identify issues in a code review, suggest improvements or alternatives rather than just pointing out problems.
- **Understand the Project Context**: Ensure you understand the project's goals and current state before suggesting major changes.

### 5. Community and Collaboration

- **Collaborate Openly**: Engage with other contributors through issues, discussions, and reviews. Collaborative contributions are highly encouraged.
- **Respect Different Opinions**: The community may have different perspectives. Respect these differences, and seek to understand and integrate them.
- **Ask for Help**: If you're unsure about how to contribute or run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help in the community forums or chat channels.
